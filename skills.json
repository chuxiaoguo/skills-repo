If enabled, this skill's patterns should guide all component authoring, data fetching, and caching decisions.\n\n**USE CASES**: Implementing 'use cache' directive, configuring cache lifetimes with cacheLife(), tagging cached data with cacheTag(), invalidating caches with updateTag()/revalidateTag(), optimizing static vs dynamic content boundaries, debugging cache issues, and reviewing Cache Component implementations.",
