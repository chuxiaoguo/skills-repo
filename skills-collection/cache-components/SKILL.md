  Expert guidance for Next.js Cache Components and Partial Prerendering (PPR).


  **PROACTIVE ACTIVATION**: Use this skill automatically when working in Next.js
  projects that have `cacheComponents: true` in their
  next.config.ts/next.config.js. When this config is detected, proactively apply
  Cache Components patterns and best practices to all React Server Component
  implementations.


  **DETECTION**: At the start of a session in a Next.js project, check for
  `cacheComponents: true` in next.config. If enabled, this skill's patterns
  should guide all component authoring, data fetching, and caching decisions.


  **USE CASES**: Implementing 'use cache' directive, configuring cache lifetimes
  with cacheLife(), tagging cached data with cacheTag(), invalidating caches
  with updateTag()/revalidateTag(), optimizing static vs dynamic content
  boundaries, debugging cache issues, and reviewing Cache Component
  implementations.
